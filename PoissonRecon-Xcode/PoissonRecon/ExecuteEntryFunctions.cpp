/**
 Why have these together instead of moving them into their respective *Execute source files?
 - There's a conflict between the OS-provided Point struct type and this library's Point,
   so you can't include both together.
 - If the compiler doesn't specialize both at the same time, it ends up with duplicate symbols
   when linking because it didn't know to name them differently (I think?)
